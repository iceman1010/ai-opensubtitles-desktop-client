API test bash scripts
---------------------------------------

Configuration is done in:   'config/config.sh'
Assets for tests are in:    'assets/'

Important values in config file:

URL_ADDON = Optional addon to URL to override DEV settings like user_id or login,
            also JSON_PRETTY=1 will give you a nicer fromated output for the CLI
URL_BASE  = This sets the base for all requests, eiter DEVELOPMENT (directly to the server),
            or PRODUCTION (using the proxy server)

First use 'login.sh' to renew the authentifiction token, if not using DEVELOPMENT settings
The token should be valid for 12 hours.

RPC functions like translation, transcription or downloads return a 'status' that can be:

CREATED     ->  Initial state
                no other information is send

PENDING     ->  procedure is still running
                can return 'data' that has update information about the pending process

COMPLETED   ->  remote procedure call is completed and has a result
                will always return 'data', that contains the process results

ERROR       ->  procedure resulted in an error and is not running anymore
                will always contain 'errors', with a list of errors

TIMEOUT     ->  No matching procedure call found before timeout
                no other information is send

First call the inital RPC function ex.: translation_initial.sh and then call
check_status_translation.sh for follow up calls.

All initial function calls will update the 'correlation_id.txt' with the latest correlation id,
that will then be used by the check_status.sh script.

Info functions that are accessed via '/info/FUNCTION_NAME' do not require authentification.
For example:

/info/translation_languages
/info/translation_apis
/info/transcription_languages
/info/transcription_apis
