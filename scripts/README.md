# Release Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts for the AI.Opensubtitles.com Client project.

## ðŸš€ release.sh

Automated release script that handles the complete release process including version bumping, GitHub Actions builds, and auto-updater metadata generation.

### Features

- âœ… **Automated Version Bumping**: Updates `package.json` with semantic versioning
- âœ… **GitHub Actions Integration**: Triggers cross-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- âœ… **Checksum Validation**: Calculates correct SHA512 checksums for all platform files
- âœ… **Auto-updater Support**: Generates proper metadata files (`latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml`, `latest-linux.yml`)
- âœ… **Multi-platform Support**: Handles all three target platforms automatically
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and rollback capabilities

### Prerequisites

The script requires these tools to be installed:

```bash
# Required dependencies
sudo apt install jq nodejs npm git

# GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate GitHub CLI
gh auth login
```

### Usage

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x scripts/release.sh

# Create patch release (1.0.9 -> 1.0.10) - default
./scripts/release.sh

# Create minor release (1.0.9 -> 1.1.0)  
./scripts/release.sh minor

# Create major release (1.0.9 -> 2.0.0)
./scripts/release.sh major

# Show help
./scripts/release.sh --help
```

### What the Script Does

1. **Version Management**: 
   - Reads current version from `package.json`
   - Increments version according to semantic versioning
   - Updates `package.json` with new version

2. **Git Operations**:
   - Commits version bump with detailed commit message
   - Pushes changes to main branch
   - Creates and pushes git tag with `v` prefix (triggers GitHub Actions)

3. **Build Monitoring**:
   - Waits for GitHub Actions builds to complete
   - Monitors release creation (indicates builds finished)
   - Timeout after 30 minutes if builds don't complete

4. **Metadata Generation**:
   - Downloads all release files (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, `.deb`)
   - Calculates correct SHA512 checksums for each platform
   - Gets file sizes and release dates
   - Generates metadata files with correct information

5. **Auto-updater Setup**:
   - Creates `latest.yml` for Windows updates
   - Creates `latest-mac.yml` for macOS updates  
   - Creates `latest-linux.yml` for Linux updates
   - Uploads all metadata files to GitHub release

### Safety Features

- **Dependency Checking**: Verifies all required tools are installed
- **User Confirmation**: Asks for confirmation before proceeding with release
- **Error Handling**: Exits on any error to prevent partial releases
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes temporary files
- **Validation**: Checks for required files and proper Git repository

### Troubleshooting

**Script exits with "package.json not found"**
- Run the script from the project root directory

**"Missing required dependencies" error**
- Install the required tools listed in Prerequisites section

**GitHub CLI authentication issues**
- Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts
- Ensure your token has `repo` and `workflow` permissions

**Builds timeout after 30 minutes**
- Check GitHub Actions workflow status manually
- Network issues or resource constraints may cause delays

### Security

- The script is safe to commit to the repository
- No secrets or tokens are hardcoded
- Uses GitHub CLI authentication (stored securely by GitHub CLI)
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
