# üöÄ Release Scripts - Quick Start Guide

## TL;DR - How to Create a Release

```bash
# From project root directory
./scripts/release.sh          # Patch release (1.0.9 ‚Üí 1.0.10)
./scripts/release.sh minor     # Minor release (1.0.9 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
./scripts/release.sh major     # Major release (1.0.9 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
```

**That's it!** The script handles everything automatically:
- ‚úÖ Version bump in package.json
- ‚úÖ Git commit, tag, and push
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions build triggering
- ‚úÖ SHA512 checksum calculation
- ‚úÖ Metadata file generation and upload
- ‚úÖ Complete cross-platform release

## ‚ö° What Happens When You Run It

### Phase 1: Version Management (30 seconds)
1. Reads current version from package.json
2. Calculates new version based on your choice
3. Updates package.json with new version
4. **User Confirmation Required** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Phase 2: Git Operations (1 minute)
5. Commits changes with detailed message
6. Pushes to main branch
7. Creates and pushes git tag (triggers GitHub Actions)

### Phase 3: Build Monitoring (5-8 minutes)
8. Waits for GitHub Actions to build all platforms
9. Monitors release creation
10. Shows progress dots while waiting

### Phase 4: Checksum Fixing (2-3 minutes)
11. Downloads all release files
12. Calculates correct SHA512 checksums
13. Generates metadata files for all platforms
14. Uploads corrected metadata to GitHub

### Result: Perfect Release ‚úÖ
- Windows users get `latest.yml`
- macOS users get `latest-mac.yml`  
- Linux users get `latest-linux.yml`
- Auto-updater works flawlessly for everyone

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "package.json not found"
```bash
# Run from project root directory
cd /path/to/ai-opensubtitles-desktop-client
./scripts/release.sh
```

### "Missing dependencies"
```bash
# Install missing tools
sudo apt install jq gh git nodejs npm
```

### "GitHub CLI not authenticated"
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow prompts to authenticate
```

### "Builds taking too long"
- Normal: 5-8 minutes for all platforms
- Check GitHub Actions page if > 15 minutes
- Script times out after 30 minutes

### Script fails midway
- **Safe to re-run**: Script checks current state
- Won't duplicate version bumps or tags
- Will resume from where it left off

## üîç Quick Status Check

### Before Running Release:
```bash
git status                    # Should be clean
git log --oneline -5         # Check recent commits
npm --version                # Verify Node.js works
gh auth status               # Verify GitHub CLI
```

### After Release Completes:
```bash
git tag                      # Should show new tag
gh release list              # Should show new release
gh release view v1.0.X       # Check release details
```

## üìã Release Checklist

**Before Release:**
- [ ] All changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] GitHub CLI authenticated
- [ ] Clean working directory

**During Release:**
- [ ] Confirm version number when prompted
- [ ] Monitor progress output
- [ ] Wait for completion message

**After Release:**
- [ ] Verify release on GitHub
- [ ] Test auto-updater with existing app
- [ ] Update any documentation with new version

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Script Hangs:
1. **Ctrl+C** to cancel
2. Check GitHub Actions manually
3. Re-run script (it's safe)

### If Release Fails:
1. Check error message in script output
2. Fix underlying issue (network, permissions, etc.)
3. Re-run script - it will resume correctly

### If Wrong Version:
1. **Don't panic** - releases can't be easily deleted
2. Create a new patch release with fixes
3. Update documentation to skip problematic version

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Timing**: Run releases during low-traffic hours for faster builds
- **Testing**: Test with patch release first if unsure
- **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on GitHub Actions while running
- **Patience**: Cross-platform builds take time - don't cancel early
- **Communication**: Announce releases to users after completion
