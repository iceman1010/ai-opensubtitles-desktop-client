1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:01,575
Not so bad. Alright, we can circle back,

2
00:00:01,615 --> 00:00:04,295
get this packed. Oh,

3
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:06,215
boy. Bet you wish you were back in the

4
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:09,423
office, huh? So,

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,023
we've got a few potential topics for

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,103
workplace research. One, do the drones

7
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:14,879
work harder if they're given gourmet

8
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:17,599
cuisine that they're later told is lab

9
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:21,655
grown human flesh? But why? Why lab grown?

10
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:25,127
That part's a lie. Option two. Was that

11
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,591
a groan of excitement? No, it's a groan of

12
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:31,287
regular grown. N why? With Lanag gone and

13
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,861
us in charge, we can do whatever we want.

14
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:36,197
But what's the point? I guess I'd say that

15
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,037
these projects let me see myself as more

16
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,101
than a cog in a soulless machine and stir

17
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,557
the cold ashes of my soul, if only for a

18
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:44,693
moment. Duh. You don't have to explain

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,509
self care to me. But then just Lana comes

20
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,317
back, undoes everything, and never leaves

21
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,213
us in charge again. So we have nothing to

22
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,317
look forward to, huh? There a reason you

23
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:56,869
have this newfound y sense of perspective?

24
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,397
Well, I'm off like 60% of my meds ever

25
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:01,013
since this stupid horse doctor had to

26
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:03,117
leave town. I told him the horse cops were

27
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,387
a bad sign. Did he listen? Yeah, I think

28
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:07,019
those were just cops riding regular

29
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,427
horses. Hey, guys. I just want you to all

30
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:11,347
work normally and have a normal day,

31
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:13,115
because apparently that's all we're here

32
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:16,055
for. Ugh. Leave me. I must brood.

33
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,347
I think you just discovered your secret

34
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:23,379
weapon. I don't like it. They've got to be

35
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:26,475
up to something. But what? I say we strike

36
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:29,395
now, before they get their plans in order,

37
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,971
so we can mess with them and not get

38
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:35,305
blamed. Perfect. And do we need to add the

39
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:37,833
human flesh thing to this? Or. God, just

40
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,513
freeze it. What is the point of going

41
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,513
back in if we don't have the detonator?

42
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,961
You should really bring backups for these

43
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:46,913
kind of important things. I shouldn't even

44
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,153
have to be here. It isn't like we asked

45
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,145
you to come. So I should have just left

46
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,777
this in the hands of a helicopter pilot

47
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,985
who can't fly, a beer drinking co pilot,

48
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,761
and the guy who can't keep track of the

49
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,577
one thing we need to accomplish the

50
00:01:58,601 --> 00:01:59,945
mission. And that.
