Official YIFY movies site:

3
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,207
Terrifying images are
coming in now of an unknown object.

4
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,999
We fear the thousands
trapped inside may already be dead.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,749
Traffic out of the evacuation zone
is at a complete standstill.

6
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,040
- So what do you think it is?
- Aliens.

7
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,207
- Definitely aliens.
- That is the finger of God!

8
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,499
They're saying
it's some kind of mineral formation.

9
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,665
Capturing the moment the object,
known as the Spike, disappeared.

10
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:16,291
Has reappeared 50 miles off
the coast of Busan, South Korea.

11
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,082
Who wants it here in Texas?

12
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,040
Responsible for numerous
strange phenomena.

13
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,665
Mass satellite failure resulting.

14
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,875
Crop failure across
agricultural regions around the world.

15
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,457
Deadly rioting continues.

16
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,665
Over 100 million dead.

17
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,082
We keep dying, and they're doing nothing!

18
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,083
Happy birthday, baby girl.

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,291
It's okay.

20
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,624
Son of a bitch!

21
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,707
Nope. Okay, it's fine.

22
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,000
Where are you? Come on, come on.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

23
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,958
Call all you want, assholes,
I still don't have any money.

24
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,625
What the fuck? How are you so long?
How are you so long?

25
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,916
Thalia, I think it's the bank.
Yeah, she's right here.

26
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,000
Hello?

27
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,249
Oh, that's so weird.

28
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,749
Sorry, yeah, I've been by my phone
all day. I didn't hear it ring once.

29
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,499
Yes, ma'am. I have a job.
I'm packing up my truck

30
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,833
right now to go first thing tomorrow
to California with my bees. I'm...

31
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:38,374
Okay. Well, I don't control
when almonds are pollinated,

32
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,125
so you're gonna get a big fat
check in about two weeks, okay? Goodbye!

33
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,790
Honey, if you need some help...

34
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,332
Please, Dad, it's not like you and
Mom have money to spare. I'll be fine.

35
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,624
I meant help packing up.

36
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,707
We could have a little time
to hang out and--

37
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,125
Dad, I don't need help, okay?

38
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,541
I know this is a hard day for you,

39
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,749
so I really appreciate you
letting us visit them.

40
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,000
- It meant a lot to everybody.
- Dad, stop!

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,291
Maybe next time clean around the graves.

42
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,791
It's disrespectful.

43
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,291
Okay, come on, girls.
Let's get you packed.

44
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,375
God, you got heavy.

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,833
What has Mama been feeding you?

46
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:55,166
I'm gonna get you on a bee diet.
Diet for bees.

47
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,250
This is gonna take all night.

48
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,833
What the fuck?

49
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,208
- Morning, Kai. Did I wake you?
- Really, Jenna?

50
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:56,375
That was a good speech you gave
at Dave's funeral.

51
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,958
- It was beautiful.
- What are you doing out here?

52
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,750
It's been a week since you
ghosted everyone, dude.

53
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,874
Look, I know you need some space,

54
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,249
but you can only skip work
so long before they fire you.

55
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,707
Whatever.

56
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,249
I can't afford my place now
that Dave's out of the picture.

57
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,957
So what, Dave's car is gonna be
your new permanent residence?

58
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,082
Well, it will be, since I can't move it.

59
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,416
- Kai.
- Now unboot me, please.

60
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,082
You gotta clean this shit up.
You're lucky I don't give you a ticket.

61
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:28,916
For what?

62
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:36,124
Uh, littering, loitering,
illegally parked vehicle, open container.

63
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,041
- Ah, that is piss.
- Oh.

64
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:48,333
Kai, I love you, but you need to stop
coming back here. It's not good for you.

65
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,833
Bring my boot back tonight.

66
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,458
Love you too, sis.

67
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:14,708
I'm tired.

68
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,375
Stop falling asleep, stupid bitch.

69
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,708
No!

70
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,333
Fuck!

71
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,332
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

72
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,374
- Hey, lady, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

73
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,249
I'm so sorry. That was my fault. I was
just parked in the middle of the road.

74
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,790
No, it's okay. I should have been paying
more attention to you.

75
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,832
- Can you help me with this, actually?
- Yeah, sure.

76
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,415
I'm just gonna adjust these straps

77
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,665
and then can you ratchet it down
when I tell you to?

78
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,083
- Okay.
- Okay, ratchet.

79
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,124
Okay, great. Thank you.

80
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,582
- Oh!
- You okay?

81
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,415
Yeah, sorry. Shit.

82
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,541
I think I just bumped my knee
when I rolled into the...

83
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,207
ditch.

84
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,583
- Sorry again about this.
- Oh, it's fine.

85
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,082
Oh, my God, I didn't ask if you were okay.
Are you okay?

86
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,415
Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh, yeah, not a scratch on me.

87
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,458
- Kai, by the way.
- I'm, uh, Thalia.

88
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,457
Sorry, I was just worried
about my-- My bees.

89
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,415
- Yeah, beekeeping, huh?
- They're fine.

90
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,166
- That's pretty neat.
- Yeah.

91
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,041
I'm sorry, can I look at your leg?

92
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,916
- What?
- Oh, it's cool. I'm an EMT.

93
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,582
Oh! Uh...

94
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,374
- No, I'm fine.
- It just looked like you bumped

95
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,707
your knee pretty hard.

96
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,207
Oh, no. It's probably just a bruise.

97
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,249
- Are you sure?
- Fucking hell! What?

98
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,665
Oh, my God, it's broken.

99
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,999
Oh, no, it's just swelling.
It's just a little swelling.

100
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,374
- You sit here, okay?
- Okay.

101
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,540
I'll get my kit. I'll be right back, okay?
You're gonna be fine.

102
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,457
- Sit tight.
- Oh, my God.

103
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,790
That's so big.

104
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,208
Oh, shit.

105
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,416
Oh, shit.

106
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,583
Got it. Don't poke at it.

107
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,040
Are you sure it's not broken?

108
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,790
If it was broken,
you wouldn't be able to walk on it.

109
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,915
Hey, that's-- Whoa! That's tight,
that's tight, that's too tight.

110
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,332
It's gotta be, trust me.

111
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,458
Okay?

112
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,625
Okay.

113
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,124
It doesn't look too bad,
so we'll just wrap this up nice and tight

114
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,541
and keep it from getting worse.

115
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,040
Right...

116
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,290
- Nice calves.
- Hm?

117
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,416
What?

118
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,166
Did you say something?

119
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,915
I said, um...

120
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,790
I said, um, do you--

121
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,833
Do I need to ice my calves later?

122
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,083
This is your knee.

123
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,375
Yep.

124
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,915
You know, leg, knee,

125
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,541
calf, it's all the same.
I mean, you're the doctor, so...

126
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,791
Well, EMT's are technically not doctors.

127
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,582
Really? What are you?

128
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,290
Well, we basically
know everything they do,

129
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,374
but we get paid less
and get to run through red lights.

130
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,291
Oh.

131
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,291
Was that your ambulance then?

132
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,208
I mean, it could be if you wanted it.

133
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,082
Excuse me?

134
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,708
- Just trying to make a joke.
- Uh...

135
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,499
- I didn't really hear a joke in there.
- Yeah, I was just messing around.

136
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,540
I don't know, it kind of sounded more like
you were using your cool car

137
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,040
to try to, I don't know, hit on me.

138
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,249
Hm?

139
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,499
- No, I wasn't, I swear.
- Okay.

140
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,915
It's not even my car.

141
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,207
It's my dead friend's car,

142
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:05,583
and I wouldn't bring up my dead friend
in order to flirt with you, okay?

143
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,083
Anyway.

144
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,916
You're good to go.

145
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,791
That sucks about your friend.

146
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,166
Yeah, well, it happens.

147
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,041
Like, all the time now, right?

148
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,000
Now, he was the cool one.

149
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,833
Hence the car.

150
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,041
He would have definitely flirted with you.

151
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,750
Well, he probably
couldn't have fixed my leg.

152
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,041
No, he could have. He was a doctor.

153
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,540
Well, um, I should probably get going.
I've got a long drive.

154
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,041
Yeah, right. Um...

155
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,708
- Well, safe drive, Thalia.
- Yeah, you too.

156
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,416
Friend.

157
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,082
- It's Kai.
- Yeah, I know.

158
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,915
I was just trying to be friendly.
I don't know.

159
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,375
Here, I'll tell you what.

160
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,833
Catch.

161
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,791
Huh.

162
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,250
Honey.

163
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,750
Thanks for the help, doc.

164
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,916
What the fuck?

165
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,458
Oh, my God, where did they go?

166
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,708
Where did they go?

167
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,291
What the fuck?

168
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,415
Oh, my God, where are they?
Where's the trailer?

169
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,957
- Where did they go?
- No! No!

170
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,791
You son of a bitch! No!

171
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,332
What is this? What is this?

172
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,791
- What the actual shit?
- Oh, my God, the Spike jumped.

173
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,249
- It was right here.
- The Spike jumped.

174
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,874
It did this. It must have.

175
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,540
Oh, no!

176
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,207
- Okay.
- Where did it go? No!

177
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,165
- You were right here.
- Okay.

178
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,540
- Okay, so--
- What the fuck?

179
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,540
Okay, so--

180
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,499
It looks like, like, two pieces of land
got swapped somehow.

181
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,665
What? The Spike can't do that, can it?
Have you ever heard of that happening?

182
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,749
So if this is-- If the land got swapped,

183
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,082
then maybe the chunk
that had all of our stuff...

184
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:46,708
This looks like a river,
so maybe it's nearby.

185
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,457
- Maybe it's nearby.
- Yeah! Yeah!

186
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,040
I know there's a river on the other side
of those hills, so maybe--

187
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,290
Yeah, it's gotta be! Okay!
Let's do this! Yeah!

188
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,458
Fuck, these aren't Arizona trees.

189
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:02,999
Are you okay?

190
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,332
- Jesus!
- This is all shit!

191
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,875
There is a god and he hates us!

192
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,083
Ow!

193
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,749
I cut my hand!

194
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,207
Dude, can you get up, please?
We need to figure this out.

195
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:26,124
Okay. Maybe this is Florida?
And that is a fish. Why is there a fish?

196
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,833
Hey, I found something.

197
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,666
- What is it?
- Pizza place. In Eastern WA.

198
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,915
Washington's like 19 hours away.

199
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,082
Okay. I can still make it.
I can still make it.

200
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,666
- Yeah. Better get a move on.
- Exactly. Thanks, Kai.

201
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,500
It's locked.

202
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,333
Uh, what are you doing?

203
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,749
Oh, right. Mud man over here. Do you have,
like, a spare shirt or something?

204
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,832
- No, you're not getting in here.
- What?

205
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,666
Of course I am.
Just give me a second to clean up.

206
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,333
Sorry.

207
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,207
Do you think you're coming
to Washington with me?

208
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,707
Yeah, I am. My car's gone too.

209
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:14,583
No, no, no. I will call you
if I find the car, but no, dude.

210
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,249
You're going to ditch me
on the side of the goddamn road?

211
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,915
- Okay.
- I found the clue. I found the bottle.

212
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,207
Look, I'm not going on a road trip
with a total stranger

213
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,665
who, frankly, seems a little
emotionally unstable. So...

214
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,208
Okay, look. I'm sorry.

215
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:41,583
It's just that car is the last thing
I have of my best friend, okay?

216
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,500
It's important to me.

217
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,666
Look, something crazy
just happened to the both of us.

218
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,208
And we're the only people
who can help each other right now.

219
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,791
Please.

220
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,415
I'm sorry. I just have...
I have to find a phone

221
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,000
and call the farm and tell them
I'm gonna be late and--

222
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Oh, the fucking bank
keeps calling me and I just...

223
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,250
I have too much shit
on my plate right now. I'm sorry.

224
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,666
How can I contact you?

225
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,874
Here.

226
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,916
I'm also a DJ.

227
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,707
Please call me if you find that car.

228
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,166
I will. I promise.

229
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,666
Or if you need a shitty DJ.

230
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,458
Goddamn it, Thalia.
What are you doing? Just fucking...

231
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,499
Just go. He's a grown man.

232
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,999
He's safe out here.
You don't have to worry about him.

233
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,790
It's 20 minutes to a gas station,
he's fine. He's a stranger.

234
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,124
It's safer not to do it.
It's safer not to do it, just...

235
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,707
It's not even that hot outside.
He could just--

236
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,249
Okay, fuck it. Fuck it.
Do the right thing.

237
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,124
- Let the stranger in to your car.
- Shit.

238
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,958
- You'll probably get murdered.
- Shit, no.

239
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,833
Kai! Come back! You can come with me!

240
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,166
- Where the fuck did he go?
- Oh, fuck.

241
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,541
Kai?

242
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,833
Come on, don't be like that.
Are you coming or what?

243
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:27,791
Kai?

244
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,125
Yeah, looks like you've got
a hole in your truck.

245
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,750
Pretty big one too.

246
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,290
I'm gonna stop at the next gas station

247
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,957
and you can get some paper towels
and clean up back there.

248
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,750
Hey, you got any mediums back here?

249
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,707
Would you just take
whatever's in there, please?

250
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,541
Uh, yeah, you got it.

251
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,957
- Do you want this open or shut?
- What?

252
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,958
- The window.
- I don't care.

253
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,125
Uh, okay.

254
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,000
- This stupid thing's kind of stuck.
- Just leave it.

255
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
- Just leave it!
- I got it.

256
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,416
Sorry.

257
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,625
You don't need to get a new beekeeper.
I will be there on Tuesday.

258
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:02,125
A 20% cut seems a little steep
for just being a couple days late.

259
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,040
You're--

260
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:08,208
I-- I hear you, but you're not going to be
behind schedule. It's not--

261
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,666
Yes, but I promise you,
it's not going to be a problem.

262
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,790
Look, my bees are going to be so goddamn
horny for your almonds,

263
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,416
I'm not going to be able to pull them off!

264
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:24,707
Yes, yeah, I apologize.
Yes, that was unprofessional. I'm just--

265
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,291
I'm just very proud of my bees.

266
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,291
Yes, a 20% cut does seem fair.

267
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay. I will see you Tuesday. Bye.

268
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,333
What?

269
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,250
That's a lot of mud.

270
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,791
Fuck!

271
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,833
Fuck. My leg, bro!

272
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,707
Dude, this car hit me!

273
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,665
Oh, dude, my leg's broken. Fuck.

274
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,665
Bro, you ran over my bro!

275
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:06,999
- Hunter, you good, dog?
- My leg's fucked up!

276
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,457
I got to get you to a hospital, dog.

277
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,125
Looks like this fuckwad's going to pay.

278
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,499
The car wasn't even on.

279
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,375
Yeah, but no one knows that,
so who are they going to believe?

280
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,124
Look, if it's cash that you want,
I don't have any.

281
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,083
Shit!

282
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,125
I told you he was poor.

283
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,415
We've been stuck here for hours, dude.
Let's just go back.

284
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:30,374
I hear you, man, but we're not going back
to the darkness, you feel?

285
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,125
- I feel.
- You know why, right?

286
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,832
Because I'm your light?

287
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,207
- Damn right! And what does light do?
- Go forward.

288
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,166
- Yes! We hit it!
- Let's go!

289
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,999
- I love you, bro.
- I love you more, bro.

290
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,125
My dog forever.

291
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,457
Can I get a full tank on three and this?

292
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,625
This doughnut's kind of stale.
Can I get a discount?

293
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,750
Absolutely not.

294
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,999
- But it's really hard.
- Can I see?

295
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,124
What do you mean, can you see?
What are you doing?

296
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,708
- Don't bite it!
- That's fine.

297
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,541
Why would you take a bite of it?

298
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,000
Because it's fine.

299
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:32,999
I said, "Mom, I'm not
gonna pay rent. This is my room."

300
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,915
No, then my mom told me to get a job
or get out. So we got out.

301
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:40,582
I called my gramps and he said if we get
to him, we could chill at his place.

302
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:44,040
Yeah, but we got a flat,
so we need some cash for a patch.

303
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,915
And, you know, we Gucci.

304
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,415
But where are you guys, like, headed?

305
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,582
Like, maybe we could give you a lift
or something.

306
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,666
He's in Vermont, so, like, I don't know.

307
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,833
- Wait, what?
- Vermont.

308
00:26:56,708 --> 00:27:00,749
Yeah, but you know that's
like 2,000 miles away, right?

309
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,250
Yeah, that's why we need 5 bucks
to fix his tire.

310
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,165
Dudes, I know your moms are, like,
bummers or whatever, but...

311
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:13,083
- No, my mom's cool.
- Yeah, his mom said he doesn't need a job.

312
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,624
Fine, whatever, but, like,

313
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:19,040
do you guys have, like, supplies
or train tickets or anything?

314
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,124
We got our bikes.

315
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,207
Yo, and Brody's got my back.
Come here, Brody.

316
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,333
Give me one of those.

317
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:30,665
You guys know if you do this,
you're going to die, right?

318
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,791
Dog, that big dick in the sky
could nut us any sec.

319
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,540
Yeah, that's what happened
to my mom's boyfriend,

320
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:40,375
which was a bummer
because, you know, my dad sucks balls.

321
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,291
Are you guys, like, not scared?

322
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:52,875
Man, we just two down-end homies
on a journey towards a better life.

323
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,083
I love you, dog.

324
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:57,833
Yeah, I get it.

325
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:00,791
I had a homie.

326
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,291
Damn, dog.

327
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,707
Was he nutted?

328
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,707
Mm. No.

329
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,040
I mean, he's dead, but...

330
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,415
- Dude, I'm sorry, dude.
- You don't have to say it like that.

331
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,125
I'm sorry about that, dog.

332
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,832
I'll tell you what.
You guys do me a solid.

333
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,040
If you clean the back of the truck,

334
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,124
I will get you the patch
and some supplies to go with it.

335
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,999
- How about that?
- Let's go!

336
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,499
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

337
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,999
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah, of course, of course, of course.

338
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,749
"Palouse River."

339
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,707
That is a long-ass river.

340
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,583
I'm gonna get you on the road.

341
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,416
Oh, hey. Check it.

342
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:56,249
So I found the river, and there's
only a couple of towns near it.

343
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,665
Our stuff's got to be around there.
I feel like that's our best bet.

344
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,791
- Oh, great. Good job.
- Thanks.

345
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,332
Yeah, so I promised Hunter and Brody

346
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,999
that I would get this for them if they
would just, like, clean up the truck.

347
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,875
Is that okay?

348
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,249
I don't... Who is that?

349
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,290
Oh, just some fellow travelers
in need of some help.

350
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,583
Okay. You can go buy it for them, then.

351
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,999
Yeah, well, I was wondering
if maybe you could get it

352
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,041
because I don't have any money.

353
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,875
You don't have any money?

354
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,790
Well, I did.

355
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:33,625
I mean, in Dave's car, I had a lot of
money and, you know, vanished, so...

356
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,957
- That was a lie. Yeah.
- It was a lie, yeah.

357
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,332
Look, come on. It's a couple of bucks.

358
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,124
I can't spare the cash, man.

359
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:46,916
Look, they're just really good guys,
and I really like them, and...

360
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,540
Little shits!

361
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:52,540
- No, no, no!
- No!

362
00:29:56,125 --> 00:30:00,916
- It's got no gas, they can't get very far.
- All right, wait up!

363
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:06,166
You're such an idiot.

364
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,332
You're the one who left
the keys in the engine.

365
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,040
- Shut the fuck up.
- Stupid. I'm tired.

366
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,791
Oh, goddammit, I'm so out of shape.

367
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,833
Just give me the good bike.

368
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,791
- I'll catch up with them.
- Hell no!

369
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,832
Have it your way.

370
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,165
Eat my entire ass!

371
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:29,000
Don't hate me because I'm in great shape.
Whoa!

372
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:33,082
- Enjoy the walk, bitch.
- That's my lumbar.

373
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,166
It's never gonna heal.

374
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,041
Hey, don't leave without me!

375
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,041
Hey!

376
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,916
Oh, I'm only 34.

377
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,415
Our generation aged so fucking fast.

378
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,957
Shit. I'm so tired.

379
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:59,832
I'm so tired all the time. Fuck.

380
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,250
- Fuck.
- Get on the back.

381
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,250
Oh, God, fine. Okay.

382
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,124
Okay.

383
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,540
You better not drop me,
you fucking asshole.

384
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,457
Okay, I'm ready. Let's do this!

385
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,957
The moon is so bright, dog.

386
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,374
- Yeah, dog.
- You shitheads!

387
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,041
- Yo, your truck's out of gas.
- I thought we were bros!

388
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,790
- Hey, where's my bike?
- I threw that shit away!

389
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,708
- God, you're such a mom.
- Off.

390
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,582
- Off the car!
- You owe me, like, another bike.

391
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,915
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah, get the fuck out of here.

392
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:11,125
- Let's ditch these moms, dude.
- Yeah, let's go to Vermont.

393
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:13,457
Vermont?

394
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,625
Yeah.

395
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:19,540
- You are biking to Vermont?
- Yeah, my pop-pop's chill as fuck.

396
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,875
He's got guns and shit, no cap.

397
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:29,957
Children, if you do this,
you will not make it.

398
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:35,208
- Do you understand? You will die.
- Hey, lady, living is dying.

399
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,999
Yeah, and we're gonna live biking
towards what we want.

400
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,457
GYAT's in the guest house.

401
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,124
You two are the dumbest motherfuckers
I've ever met.

402
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,207
Whatever.

403
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,540
Rather get nutted
because we did something dumb...

404
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,625
Than get nutted doing nothing
'cause we're dumb.

405
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,708
- Chew on that, mom.
- Don't call me mom.

406
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:00,916
Yeah, get out of here.

407
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,082
It's just me and you, Brody.
Forever, man. For life, okay?

408
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,540
You guys are gonna get nutted, dog.

409
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:13,374
Nutting is like what they call it
when the Spike kills someone.

410
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,333
Not, you know...

411
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,500
I want to go to bed.

412
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,625
We'll get more gas tomorrow.

413
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:24,250
Okay.

414
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,125
Stupid shitheads.

415
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,125
Come on.

416
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,083
Are you jerking off in my truck?

417
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,332
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

418
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,750
No, I'm just...

419
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,375
I'm going to sleep.

420
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:50,083
- Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
- It's okay. Good night.

421
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:59,750
It's just little things
have been setting me off lately.

422
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:05,750
And, uh, I saw your kid's drawings
and your photo.

423
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,665
You never mentioned
you had a family, so I just...

424
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,041
I assumed the worst.

425
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,833
My friend's funeral was like
two weeks ago, so I guess I'm just...

426
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,041
Seeing death everywhere.

427
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:20,791
Yeah.

428
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,416
Your family's okay, right?

429
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,541
Um...

430
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,416
My husband and daughter died
six years ago.

431
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,625
Please don't, Kai.

432
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,749
- I'm being so rude.
- No, you're not.

433
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,332
I'm just-- Sorry, just give me a minute.

434
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,499
Ow.

435
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,416
No, Kai, we don't-- It's not--

436
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,625
- Just one second.
- Let's just go to sleep, huh?

437
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:08,208
I'm sorry.

438
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:13,625
I didn't mean to bring all that up.

439
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,041
Please continue.

440
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,457
I was saying we should go to sleep.

441
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,375
Right, yeah.

442
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,207
Can I ask you a question?

443
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,375
Uh, yeah, go ahead.

444
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,333
Does it get easier?

445
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:57,083
Yeah. It gets easier.

446
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:00,750
That's good.

447
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:09,000
Dave was really good
at shrugging stuff off. I could--

448
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,625
I could never get the hang of it.

449
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:18,250
You know, when the Spike hit,
I sort of spiraled out of control.

450
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,124
Yeah, I think a lot of people did.

451
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,208
Yeah.

452
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,624
The world was going insane,

453
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:31,833
and I was staring at patient charts
and doing paperwork.

454
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,416
It didn't make any sense, so I quit.

455
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,125
Dave was the only reason
that I ended up as a paramedic, at least.

456
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:48,333
He kept me from
totally going off the rails.

457
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,040
Sorry. Here.

458
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,916
Let me give this back to you.

459
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,250
You know he built that car?

460
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,707
He's not even a car guy.

461
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:23,708
One day he just bought a roller
and pieced it together from scratch.

462
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,083
It took him years.

463
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:36,250
You know, we were gonna go on this road
trip to celebrate it finally being done.

464
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:45,916
Sorry.

465
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,291
I'm rambling.

466
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,458
It's just, I really thought
he had his shit together.

467
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:56,625
But I guess not.

468
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,458
And if he didn't, then...

469
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:07,375
How did he die?

470
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,791
He killed himself.

471
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:17,666
Fuck.

472
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,500
I'm sorry.

473
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,083
I guess I just assumed it was the Spike.

474
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,416
It must make it a lot harder.

475
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,583
Spike, suicide.

476
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:55,625
Dead is dead.

477
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,416
What about your family?

478
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:06,333
Spike?

479
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:08,708
Um...

480
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,708
No. Uh, it was a car crash.

481
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,041
Fuck.

482
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,916
Yeah, semi just, you know...

483
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:24,000
ran into oncoming traffic.

484
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,583
It was like a wrong place,
wrong time kind of thing, but, um...

485
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,208
But it was instantaneous, so...

486
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,166
No, it wasn't. I don't...

487
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,125
I don't fucking know
why I always say that.

488
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,875
I guess it's to make it easier
for other people.

489
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:53,291
It wasn't instantaneous, but I...

490
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,833
got to say goodbye to my daughter,
so there's that.

491
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,125
Anyway.

492
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,458
History.

493
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,291
Just gotta let go of the things
that hurt you.

494
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,333
That's like everything nowadays.

495
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:32,708
Just find something that keeps you going
and hang on to that.

496
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,458
Is that beekeeping for you?

497
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,749
Does that keep you happy?

498
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,125
I didn't say happy.

499
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,040
I'd be pretty arrogant to aim
for happiness right now,

500
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,791
but it does keep me going.

501
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:57,333
I don't know.

502
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,458
I still think it's okay
to aim for some happiness.

503
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,625
Well, I hope you find some.

504
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,291
Me too.

505
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:14,000
As in, I hope you do as well.

506
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:23,625
Well, if you really want to make me happy,
you'll go the fuck to sleep.

507
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:31,208
- I need to go to sleep.
- Copy that.

508
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,083
Hey.

509
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:44,540
Thanks for listening.

510
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:56,457
Fuck it! God-fucking-damn it!

511
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:58,708
Morning.

512
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:00,791
Yeah.

513
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,790
- So we've got, like, 14--
- How's the swelling?

514
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,166
- Oh, sorry. Your leg.
- What?

515
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,291
Did the swelling go down?

516
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:15,333
Uh, yeah. It's fine. Um...

517
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,957
We've got a long drive to Washington,

518
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,457
and we probably
should have left an hour ago.

519
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,415
- Right.
- You're up first.

520
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:23,583
Aye, aye, captain.

521
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:26,625
I'll just go drain the main vein.

522
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,291
Drain the main vein?
Who the fuck says that?

523
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,875
Hey, do you like 20 questions?

524
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,165
Because I'm kind of a beast at it.

525
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:41,374
Um, I don't really like games.

526
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:42,625
Oh, that's cool.

527
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:44,875
We could just chat.

528
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,249
Like, what's your favorite album?

529
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,749
Me, I have a few,
but it really just depends on my mood.

530
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,375
I need to sleep before my shift, Kai.

531
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,583
- You're gonna sleep?
- Yes.

532
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,165
Oh, come on!

533
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:01,833
Shooting the shit
is the best part of road trips.

534
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:05,749
Me and Dave, we just talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

535
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,332
Look, Kai, I'm not Dave, okay?
This is not some fun trip for me.

536
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,375
It's work.

537
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,875
Okay.

538
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,500
Fine.

539
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:22,333
Of course, you're not Dave.

540
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,583
Talk to not Dave.

541
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:30,375
In fact, nowadays,
we only talk to not Daves.

542
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:33,916
I'm sorry.

543
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:40,666
Let's just, you know,
focus on the mission.

544
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,125
Right?

545
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,208
You're right. Sorry.

546
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,125
The mission. Got it.

547
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,374
- You got any music or anything?
- Radio's busted.

548
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,583
That's cool.

549
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:48,333
Kai, what are you doing?
That's so annoying.

550
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:53,165
- Sorry. Did I wake you?
- No, but what are you doing?

551
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:56,374
Well, I'm making a smoke bubble
in my mouth.

552
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,874
- Have you never done that?
- I have no idea what you're saying.

553
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,291
Like the science experiment.

554
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,540
With the clouds in the bottles?

555
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:04,666
You can do it with your mouth. Watch this.

556
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,457
Okay, it didn't really work that time.

557
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:18,958
- When it happens--
- I'm going back to sleep.

558
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,333
All right.

559
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:31,875
Screw it. I got one.

560
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:36,332
- Got what?
- I have a thing for 20 questions.

561
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:39,208
- You want to play 20 questions?
- Oh, okay. Uh...

562
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,208
- Is it an animal?
- Yes.

563
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,000
Is it a bee?

564
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,749
Buh, buh, buh, buh!

565
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,665
- Oh, my God. Wow!
- You got it.

566
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,957
- That was the quickest I've ever done it.
- Oh my God. Mmm.

567
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:53,124
Okay, my turn.

568
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:59,707
Okay, hold on.
So it's smaller than a paper clip.

569
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,916
- And it's medium furry?
- Mm-hm.

570
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,208
- Nineteen. Last one.
- What the--

571
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,458
Goddamn it, is it a fucking bee?

572
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,583
Oh, don't smile at me, you cheater.
Piece of shit.

573
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:19,916
Okay, here we go.

574
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,625
Sushi.

575
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,082
- I want to eat sushi now.
- I don't get why we can't eat it anymore.

576
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,832
Something to do with, like,
the way that the Spike interacts

577
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:34,624
with heavy metals in the ocean
or something. I don't know.

578
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,040
Like it makes it poisonous, I guess.

579
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,332
- Fuck the CDC.
- Honestly, I don't give a fuck.

580
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,916
- I would eat it. I would still eat it.
- Me either. I would eat that shit all day.

581
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,540
This is our exit, 89 North.

582
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,790
Wait, isn't it safer
to cut across through Nevada?

583
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:54,707
Yeah, but we're sticking to main roads
and we're not stopping anywhere, so...

584
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,124
This will be faster.

585
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:59,000
- Well, this goes through New Zion, right?
- Yeah.

586
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:02,874
- And across to Glass Lake.
- Yes.

587
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:06,541
- Why are you asking? What's the problem?
- Nothing, no. I just, um...

588
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:10,707
Dave wanted to see the Glass Lake.

589
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:13,500
It was, like,
his number one spot on the list.

590
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,250
Have you seen it? Is it cool?

591
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,999
Uh, it's a large lake of glass
where a bunch of people died,

592
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,332
if that's cool to you.

593
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,708
Yeah, right.

594
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:28,790
We can't go around it,
so are you going to be okay?

595
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:30,708
I'm good. Why?

596
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:36,999
- Really?
- I'm not going to cry again.

597
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,582
Look, I'll probably just, like,
sleep through it or something.

598
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:41,374
No, I should look at it.

599
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,957
Dave wanted to see it, so I should...

600
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,166
I'll be fine. We'll be fine. I'm fine.

601
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,125
Great.

602
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,583
I wonder why Dave
wanted to see this so bad.

603
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:14,333
I probably should have asked him.

604
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,958
- Whoa, Thalia!
- Sorry. Sorry.

605
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,290
- All I'm saying is, I don't think--
- Can we not when--?

606
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:44,750
Never mind. Keep going, it's fine.

607
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:48,332
I'm not saying I want to kill to survive,

608
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:52,000
but, like, I gotta pay rent
and bills and shit.

609
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:56,041
Like, we're out here because
you need to pay your mortgage, right?

610
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,374
Yeah.

611
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,666
I don't think anyone expected
the end of civilization to be so normal.

612
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
That's normal to you?

613
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:12,166
- Well, it was just pissing, like we do.
- Oh, I hate that.

614
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,415
- Come on.
- Just turn it off.

615
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:19,707
- You're not going to find something.
- I'm going to find something.

616
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:22,290
You just need to be a little patient, please.

617
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,416
Did I break it?

618
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:41,875
- Those are footsteps.
- They're getting closer.

619
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,540
- Yeah!
- Jesus.

620
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,207
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What the--?

621
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:54,624
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

622
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,957
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

623
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:59,915
Yeah!

624
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:01,708
- Oh, he's still going.
- Oh!

625
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:08,958
- That's it?
- That was amazing.

626
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:14,457
- He's insane.
- He's not insane.

627
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:16,541
He's just living his best life.

628
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:21,832
I'm sorry. It kind of sounds like you
kind of want to be like Yeah Man.

629
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:23,540
Hell yeah, I do.

630
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:25,874
You want to broadcast
your dumb life on the radio?

631
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:31,208
Well, I wouldn't do that personally, but,
you know, I would do something like that.

632
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:33,500
Like what?

633
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,041
- Live my life on the open road.
- Okay.

634
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,749
I mean, maybe it's a little selfish,

635
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:47,665
but my plan right now is to get
the car back and just drift around.

636
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,416
No destination, no rules.

637
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:54,750
Just get away from everything
and everyone.

638
00:54:57,416 --> 00:55:00,374
Hm. Nothing wrong
with being a little selfish.

639
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:01,291
Right?

640
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,874
I mean, I haven't told anyone my plan.

641
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:07,500
Not my sister, not my friends.

642
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:11,708
You're the only person who knows.

643
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:17,041
Sometimes it's easier
to talk to people you don't know.

644
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,666
True.

645
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,082
- They don't judge you.
- Oh, I'm judging you.

646
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,957
- I think you're as weird as Yeah Man.
- He's not weird.

647
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,749
Yes, he is. You're just weird too,
so you can't see it.

648
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,915
You milk bugs for a living.

649
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,582
I don't milk. Do you think bees are--?

650
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,083
I'm sorry, do you...?
Where do you think honey comes from?

651
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,333
- Their udders.
- I can't believe you're an EMT.

652
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:44,165
They have found hives that are,
no joke, over 100 years old.

653
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:47,540
As long as some of the bees survive,
the hive just keeps going.

654
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:48,790
Really?

655
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:51,790
Kind of like, um, do you know,
like, sourdough starter?

656
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,874
- Yeah.
- You can take that sourdough starter

657
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:56,374
and make a bunch of bread with it,
but the original starter,

658
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:58,457
- it just goes on forever.
- Right.

659
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:01,958
- Yeah.
- So, in a way, bees live forever.

660
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:06,249
Yeah, kind of.

661
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,250
I guess the hive does, or it can.

662
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:12,249
So what happens when the queen dies?

663
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:15,415
That's the craziest part.
They can just make new queens.

664
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,957
- What?
- I know!

665
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,749
So, basically, they just have
this thing called royal jelly,

666
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,540
and then they feed it to any bee,

667
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:25,499
and that bee goes from living like a month
to living three to five years.

668
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,707
- That is crazy.
- It just goes to show,

669
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,875
any bitch can be a queen
if you feed her right.

670
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,750
You need to put that on a shirt.

671
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,457
Fuck, that's such a good idea.

672
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:45,249
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know what's going on here?

673
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:49,249
Some park ranger just rolled by and said
it's backed up because of cult shit.

674
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,332
They're having some big bonfire
and feast or something.

675
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,665
Do you know how long this might take?

676
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:57,207
The ranger said they usually wait
till nightfall to clear them out,

677
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:59,166
so I'd get comfortable.

678
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,041
Okay, I found a back road.

679
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:08,541
- It's better than waiting here.
- Wait, the back roads? You sure?

680
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:11,499
I mean, maybe it'll clear up
sooner than they think.

681
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,915
Can't waste time. Gotta go.

682
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:16,458
Gotta go! The bees can't wait forever.

683
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,499
Hopefully we can get there before
nightfall so we can actually support--

684
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,000
- What was that?
- Shit.

685
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,916
Yeah, it's definitely shredded.

686
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:58,666
Oh, you need a hand?

687
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,790
- And the spare's flat.
- What? How?

688
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:07,665
- From the last time I had a flat.
- Right. Well, maybe we can push it.

689
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:11,290
I'm so fucking stupid. Why didn't I wait?
Why didn't I just fucking wait?

690
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,625
Hey, you're not stupid, okay?
We'll figure it out.

691
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,124
- We can maybe drive on it.
- To where?

692
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,915
We're out in the middle of nowhere
and we're miles from the main road.

693
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:23,999
Okay, we could use duct tape.
I think I saw some duct tape in the back.

694
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,207
You know, just duct tape it
and we can just push it

695
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,250
- and it'll get us to the road at least.
- Kai, come on.

696
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:30,875
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

697
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:38,082
- They seem like the self-sufficient type.
- They might have an air compressor.

698
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,665
Yeah, and a stockpile of ammo.

699
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:43,082
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- I don't have a choice.

700
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:44,499
We can't be stuck
in the middle of nowhere.

701
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,499
Yeah, exactly.

702
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,457
No help, no witnesses,
nowhere to find our bodies.

703
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,124
Look, I'm okay.
If you want to go back, it's okay.

704
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,250
You can go. I'm fine.

705
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:55,582
We need to fix the tire, okay?
I just don't want to get shot.

706
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:59,833
Well, then just be quiet
and look, I don't know, friendly.

707
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:03,333
Shit!

708
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,874
Thalia, stay low. I'll draw that fire.

709
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:07,832
What? Kai!

710
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:10,540
Hey, you fucks!
Let me see if you can hit this, huh?

711
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,540
- Kai, get down!
- Thalia, run!

712
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:14,333
- Get down!
- Thalia, get out of here!

713
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,915
You can't shoot me, can you, cocksucker?

714
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:20,165
Shut your mouth, shit stick.

715
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:23,833
That was just a warning shot.
Now get off my land!

716
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:25,458
Um...

717
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:27,708
Hi.

718
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:29,290
Sorry.

719
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,207
Our tire just blew out up the road

720
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:33,583
and we were wondering
if you had an air compressor.

721
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:36,375
Yeah, of course I got one.

722
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,833
Oh, okay, great.

723
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:40,582
Would you mind if we--?

724
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:43,999
Nobody comes to these back roads
unless they're looking for trouble.

725
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,874
Now I'm going to count to three and these
next shots won't be warning shots.

726
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:51,290
It's just going to take a second.
Just a minute and then we'll be gone.

727
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53,749
I don't help militia or meth heads.

728
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,540
- Why?
- Lady, I'm just a beekeeper.

729
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:58,082
And I'm unemployed. Not because of meth.

730
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:02,457
Uh, I quit. Not meth.
I've never done meth. I quit my job.

731
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,125
- He's never done meth.
- I'm on a--

732
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:13,125
- Did you say a beekeeper?
- Yeah, that's what she said.

733
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,165
Why, do you need one?

734
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:28,500
Hello, little ladies. Don't mind me.

735
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,124
See, she ain't getting stung.

736
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,582
What were you doing?

737
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,540
Don't worry,
she's a professional beekeeper.

738
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:40,958
Don't talk to my kid.

739
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,332
Hey, you want to see something cool?

740
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:48,540
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Oh, Thalia, don't talk to the kids.

741
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:49,375
She can.

742
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:51,750
You can't.

743
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,125
Come here, it's okay.

744
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,958
Go on, you heard the lady.

745
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,041
Don't worry.

746
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,000
If we're calm, they'll be calm.
And they won't sting us.

747
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,041
See?

748
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,333
You see this?

749
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:27,415
This is the queen.

750
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:28,666
Pretty cool, huh?

751
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,165
I know those bees seem scary,

752
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,415
but it was only because
they were trying to protect her.

753
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:36,500
And wherever she goes, they go too.

754
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:39,499
So you stay here,
I'm going to show you something cool.

755
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,666
Okay, stay right here.

756
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,666
Sorry in advance, little ladies.

757
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,666
You see that?

758
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:13,332
They're all going in the hive box,
because they know their queen's in there.

759
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:16,165
Those ones with their little butts up
and flapping their wings,

760
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:17,457
they're spreading her scent.

761
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,582
And then they're all going to get
to work gathering pollen,

762
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,999
and then they make wax cones

763
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,207
so they have a place
for all that delicious honey.

764
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,750
It's going to be their new home.

765
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:26,375
Pretty cool, huh?

766
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:38,790
Um, It'll take a couple hours
for them to hole up,

767
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,500
and then you can put them wherever.

768
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:45,915
That was so cool.
Seeing you in your element, really.

769
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:51,000
And plunging your hands into a pile of
bees was the craziest shit I've ever seen.

770
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,665
It's not a big deal.

771
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,874
Did you see that kid?
She thought you were a supey.

772
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:57,249
- Are you done yet?
- I'm going as fast as I can.

773
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,500
Well, go fucking faster.

774
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,916
Okay, I'm almost done. It's all good.

775
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:05,166
It's okay.

776
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,290
It's okay. It's not okay.

777
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:10,874
- Oh, God. I have to get this stuff.
- Thalia?

778
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:12,749
- It's going to be nice.
- You okay?

779
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,207
- It's going to be fine.
- Hey.

780
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:16,207
- It's going to be there.
- Thalia. Hey, hey, hey.

781
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,999
- I'm okay. It's okay.
- Thalia? It's okay.

782
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,374
Hey, sit down, sit down.
You're okay, you're okay.

783
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:25,082
Thalia, breathe, breathe.
You're having a panic attack, okay?

784
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:26,957
Just breathe with me.
You're going to be okay.

785
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:28,874
- I'm so fucking stupid.
- No, no, no.

786
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,124
- Why'd I do this?
- Thalia, just breathe.

787
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,040
- I'm going to lose the house.
- Just breathe.

788
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:35,040
- Breathe with me. You're okay.
- I'm going to lose them.

789
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:37,458
You're okay. You're okay.

790
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:41,041
You're okay. You're okay.

791
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,083
You're okay.

792
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:45,375
You're okay.

793
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,415
You're okay.

794
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:00,833
You're okay.

795
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:07,291
You're okay.

796
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,625
Friday was my daughter's birthday.

797
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,583
My parents and my in-laws came over to...

798
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,291
I don't know, celebrate, grieve.

799
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,208
She liked bugs.

800
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,625
I think she would've liked beekeeping.

801
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,208
I'm sorry.

802
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,583
What are you gonna do?

803
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,416
Come on. Let's go.

804
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:13,416
Seriously, I'm okay.
This is not my first rodeo.

805
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,166
But thank you.

806
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:21,040
Hey, it's my job, right?

807
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:22,416
It was your job.

808
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,874
Was it? You get fired? What happened?
Are you still an EMT?

809
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:29,249
- Nah, I've definitely been fired.
- Should've been a combat medic.

810
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,375
- With all your zigzagging around.
- Pretty good, right?

811
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,290
There's only one more town around here,
but this road runs parallel to the river,

812
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:48,874
so I don't know.

813
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,540
Maybe it's a roadside pizza place
or something?

814
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:54,207
Maybe in the morning
we can find a local and ask them.

815
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:56,500
It's kind of too dark.

816
01:05:58,583 --> 01:05:59,708
That's it, right?

817
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,999
These cozy, small-town vibes.

818
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,500
- I hate it.
- Yep.

819
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:29,457
Here it is.

820
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,500
So much for the best 'za
in Eastern WA.

821
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,375
Come on, let's just look for the river.

822
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:42,332
I think I see something in here.

823
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,666
Kai, what are you doing?

824
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:47,958
What are you--? Don't go. Kai!

825
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:51,083
What? Damn it. Kai.

826
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:53,499
- Jeez!
- I'm sorry, Kai.

827
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,875
I didn't get very far,
but look, I found the same bottle.

828
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:00,874
Okay. We're already here.
We need to find the river.

829
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,791
Right, yeah.

830
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,540
What was that?

831
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,833
I don't know,
maybe like a possum or something?

832
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,500
- Have you ever heard a possum before?
- No.

833
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,624
- Fuck, shit.
- What the hell was that?

834
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:17,749
I don't know.

835
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,041
Turn off your light. Turn off your light.

836
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,374
- Jackpot!
- Fuck.

837
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,750
This looks like a good one.

838
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,457
You folks in there, want to come see it?

839
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,833
Uh, excuse me?

840
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,790
Still, a 1990.

841
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,040
- Old one.
- Serial killer.

842
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:39,000
It's worth a look.

843
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:44,791
Not the oldest one I got,
but still pretty old for a penny.

844
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,749
Does he look crazy?

845
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,707
Thalia, what are you doing?

846
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:51,874
If you find anything in there from 1914,
let me know.

847
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,583
It's the only one I got missing.

848
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:57,874
Uh, we're not looking for coins.

849
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:02,708
- Is that what you're doing?
- Yeah, it's what I do nowadays.

850
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:07,875
Used to live here, me and my mom.
She got the lung cancer now.

851
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:11,166
Dad died when the town did.

852
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:14,958
Oh, I'm, uh, sorry to hear that. Uh...

853
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:18,624
This might be a weird question,
but you haven't happened to see

854
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,665
like a bunch of bees somewhere?

855
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:23,166
Or a Nissan 300ZX?

856
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,291
It's a sports car. Maybe in the river.

857
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,957
Nope. Can't say that I have.

858
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:34,415
I would know, though.
I've been up and down the river all week.

859
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:35,708
Where are you folks from?

860
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,291
- Uh, Arizona.
- Arizona? Check this.

861
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:44,083
- You know, we should probably go.
- Ta-da!

862
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:47,500
Wheat Penny, 1912.

863
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,916
- Oh.
- Oh, that's very old.

864
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:55,666
1912.

865
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:59,125
The year Arizona became a state.

866
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:00,457
- Right.
- Right.

867
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:04,124
That means that this little penny
has been floating around

868
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:07,541
all these years
and found its way into my hands.

869
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,708
And now into yours, Arizona lady.

870
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:13,915
Thank you.

871
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,166
I got another one
in a little better condition.

872
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:20,333
We should probably get going, right?

873
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,665
- Yeah, right.
- I understand.

874
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:25,499
I should probably get home to my mom.

875
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,625
She don't talk much.
Not like you two chatterboxes.

876
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:32,249
Her throat hurts something fierce.

877
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,750
"More tea, please."

878
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,625
That's about what our conversation is.

879
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,333
God bless her, though.

880
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,040
Strongest, sweetest woman I know.

881
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:46,875
Tea and pennies don't sound like much,

882
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,583
but I figure some folks got less.

883
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:56,833
Anyway, I wish you guys the best of luck
with finding what you're looking for.

884
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,915
Penny Man is a really good
serial killer name.

885
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,166
Sir, wait.

886
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:15,166
Here. Um...

887
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:18,082
This is the good stuff,
especially the buckwheat.

888
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:21,332
This is from a couple of hives
on the edge of my farm.

889
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,958
And it's really good in tea,
so your mom should love it.

890
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,374
That's just real nice of you.

891
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,208
It's from both of us.

892
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:35,375
Thalia's Bee Sweet Honey. That's a hoot.

893
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:39,166
I'll be.

894
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:45,333
I saw that. I thought it was a turtle.

895
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:51,082
Where did you find this?

896
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:54,582
Campground about a half hour from here.
Real nice place.

897
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,875
Could you, um...? could you show us where?

898
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:01,291
Yeah, right there.

899
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:06,125
That's a little far from here.

900
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:09,416
That's not even on the main river.

901
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,708
- We would have never found this place.
- No.

902
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,500
I'm glad I talked to that guy.

903
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:19,875
That was nice of you, by the way.

904
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:24,000
- Giving him that honey?
- All right.

905
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:28,790
Let's go to bed.
I got an early start tomorrow.

906
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,000
Seriously.

907
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,582
- You're a nice person.
- Please.

908
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,790
You know, I was thinking when he left,
I should have charged him.

909
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,125
No, you didn't.

910
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:41,000
Just like you weren't going to leave me
on the side of the road.

911
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:45,124
Okay, fine, you caught me.
I'm a nice person.

912
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,040
And nice people deserve to be happy.

913
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:51,208
You should give yourself
a break sometimes.

914
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:59,082
You should give your back a break,
you geezer.

915
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:00,375
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

916
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:03,874
One fall from a bike and I am ruined.

917
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:07,958
That's what it means to be an old man.

918
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:09,958
Good night.

919
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:20,208
- Kai?
- Yeah.

920
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,250
- This is stupid. Just sleep back here.
- What? No.

921
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,332
Wait. Yeah?

922
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,541
We can both fit back here. Come on.

923
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:34,125
Oh.

924
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:41,208
Okay, how do you want to do this?

925
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,374
Feet to head, head to feet?

926
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,749
I'm not sleeping with your feet
in my face. It's gross.

927
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,083
Right.

928
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:50,708
Okay, well, uh...

929
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,083
Are you 12? Don't make it weird.
Just lay down.

930
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:00,874
Don't get your hopes up.
Nothing's going to happen.

931
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:02,875
I literally just said don't make it weird.

932
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:05,583
Sorry.

933
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:16,666
- Kai, what are you doing?
- I'm just getting under the blanket.

934
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,416
Oh, my God.

935
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:21,625
Okay.

936
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,750
- Okay, I'm getting there.
- Stop.

937
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:26,583
I'm sorry.

938
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,415
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
What are you doing?

939
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:43,458
Just, it's a bit loose.

940
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,707
Cool. Can we handle that tomorrow, please?

941
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,540
- Sure.
- Great.

942
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,958
Thank you. Good night.

943
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:58,665
Oh, my God. What is happening?

944
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:03,624
There is, like, a metal ring
or something stuck in my back.

945
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,915
Oh, it's just the carabiner, probably.
Just unhook it.

946
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:07,457
- The what?
- What do you mean the what?

947
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:08,790
It's a carabiner.

948
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:10,332
What is it doing?

949
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,582
It just keeps the mattress
from shifting around.

950
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:14,374
Just unclick it.

951
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,999
- Unclick it?
- Yes.

952
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:18,915
It's... I can't find it.

953
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:20,374
- What do you mean you can't?
- It is so dark in here.

954
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,540
Oh, my God, move.

955
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,833
Oh, my God.

956
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:32,791
See?

957
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,625
Better?

958
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,083
Yeah, much.

959
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:56,625
You made it weird.

960
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,000
Honk, honk.

961
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:02,916
Now it's weird.

962
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,665
Good night.

963
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:14,875
Good night.

964
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:43,040
Oh, my God. What's that?

965
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:45,040
What is it? Did you hear that?

966
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,374
- What is that?
- Come on, slugabug.

967
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,499
- Get up.
- What?

968
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,666
Up, up, up.

969
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,707
What the fuck? What the fuck?

970
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:16,707
The farm is like 18 hours away,
so if I leave by sundown,

971
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:18,040
I should make it.

972
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,790
It's cutting it close, right?

973
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,375
I'll just have to drive all night,
load up on coffee or something.

974
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:26,875
Tell you what, I'll follow you.

975
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,541
If I see you drifting off,
I'll lay on my horn.

976
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:35,582
Oh, what a gentleman.
You gonna escort me the whole way?

977
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,291
Sure.
I've always wanted to go to California.

978
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:41,000
And after that?

979
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:44,125
I don't know. See where the road takes me.

980
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:50,040
Thalia, the river.

981
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,499
- Come on. Follow me. Hurry up.
- Kai! Where are you going?

982
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,999
- Upstream.
- Oh, right.

983
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,750
Yeah.

984
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,207
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Follow me. Hurry up.

985
01:16:58,208 --> 01:16:59,416
What? Yeah.

986
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:04,207
- Come on,
- Hurry up. I see red. I see red.

987
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:05,083
It's here.

988
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,041
Oh! Oh.

989
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,291
Fuck.

990
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,374
- Oh, my gosh.
- Fuck.

991
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:19,458
You're actually here.

992
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:22,208
Oh! Oh, you're here.

993
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:27,874
Okay, okay. I really found you.

994
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:29,666
I can't believe we found you.

995
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:34,166
God, you're a little stuck. It's fine.

996
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:38,375
We're going to get you out of here.
We're gonna get you out of here.

997
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,208
Maybe a few drifted down the river,
we could go check.

998
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:42,000
Is there anything salvageable?

999
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:50,957
Queen's still here.

1000
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:54,125
I know it's just one bee,
but it's sourdough, right?

1001
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,083
I'm...

1002
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,583
I'm sorry.

1003
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:03,541
Why are you sorry?

1004
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,625
It's not your fault.

1005
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:09,708
This thing fucked us, should've known
the river would be a river.

1006
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:21,250
What a fucking waste.

1007
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:26,624
- Hey, where are you going?
- I gotta call the farm.

1008
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,833
Tell them I'm not coming,
that should be a quick conversation.

1009
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,250
Why would you kick it in?

1010
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:35,332
I'm not dragging a wet box back.

1011
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:39,625
- Yeah, but you killed the--
- Kai, will you just leave it?

1012
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,083
Yeah, sure.

1013
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,541
I can get home by tonight.

1014
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,541
Try and convince the bank
not to foreclose on me.

1015
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,333
Let's get some food, I'm starving.

1016
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:04,166
Hey, you know what?
I think I'm gonna stay.

1017
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,333
You're kidding, right?

1018
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,375
No.

1019
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,458
Kai, this car is trash.

1020
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:18,208
What are you gonna do,
drag it out with your bare hands?

1021
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:20,250
I'll figure it out.

1022
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,166
Kai, come on, just forget it.

1023
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:25,416
No, I'm gonna stay.

1024
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,708
Okay. Um...

1025
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:41,082
Yeah, sure, I guess I could pull my truck,

1026
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:43,874
I don't know, through the trees
and maybe get a winch and--

1027
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,375
No, I'm good.

1028
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,249
At least let me bring you
to a service station.

1029
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,791
You've done enough, it's okay.
I'm good. Just go.

1030
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,875
Kai, what's going on? Why don't...?

1031
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,958
Why don't you want to come back with me?

1032
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:02,916
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

1033
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:06,791
You just gave up.

1034
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:10,166
What are you talking about?

1035
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:14,790
I didn't give up shit,
that was taken from me.

1036
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,749
That wasn't.

1037
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,249
That piece of shit box was nothing.

1038
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:21,166
- You didn't have to kill them.
- They're just fucking bees, Kai.

1039
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,208
Right, they mean nothing.

1040
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,375
You just threw them away,
that's what you do.

1041
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:31,666
That's what you do.

1042
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:37,332
Fuck you, you don't know me.

1043
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:40,083
You're right, I don't.

1044
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:59,374
Will you let them know
that I can make a payment

1045
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:01,083
when I'm back in a couple of days?

1046
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,291
You did, okay. Um...

1047
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,416
That's fine. Um...

1048
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,541
Yeah, yeah. Um...

1049
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:14,499
Why don't I...? I'll just...
I'll just sell the truck

1050
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,290
and it's not a ton of money, but--

1051
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:17,375
No, Mom, don't get--

1052
01:22:20,291 --> 01:22:21,458
Hi, Dad.

1053
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,375
Yeah.

1054
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:27,624
Uh-huh. Okay, I'll pay you back, okay.

1055
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:29,208
All right. You too.

1056
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:36,791
Can I get you anything?

1057
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,375
- Uh, could you just give me a second?
- Oh, yeah, of course, take your time.

1058
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:46,000
Actually, fuck it,
do you have good pancakes?

1059
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,958
Uh, is there such a thing as bad pancakes?

1060
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:54,457
Yes, store-bought shit, box shit.

1061
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:58,874
Ma'am, if you'll excuse my French, we have
the best goddamn pancakes in the state.

1062
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:03,166
Made from scratch, local farm-fresh eggs,
butter churned this morning.

1063
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:05,625
My Nana's recipe.

1064
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:09,625
Yeah, I want that.

1065
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:16,000
Oh, fuck.

1066
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:20,833
Hello there.

1067
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:32,416
Nice.

1068
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:49,665
More. More.

1069
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:52,832
- Customers can do this on their own too.
- You're doing great. More.

1070
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:54,124
Just keep going.

1071
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:57,582
It's moving! It's moving! Spike's moving!

1072
01:23:57,583 --> 01:24:00,915
Life threatening Spike activity detected.

1073
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:03,540
This is not a drill. You are in danger.

1074
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:05,833
Evacuate immediately.

1075
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:14,540
Do not shelter in place.
Life threatening Spike activity detected.

1076
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:17,082
This is not a drill. You are in danger.

1077
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:19,040
Evacuate immediately.

1078
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:20,958
Life threatening Spike--

1079
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:50,166
Sorry, buddy.

1080
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,125
If you didn't want your car jacked up...

1081
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,750
you shouldn't have fucking
killed yourself.

1082
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:12,541
Mmm.

1083
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:15,791
Hm. Mm...

1084
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:30,082
- Keep it down!
- Fuck! I did not know you were there.

1085
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,083
God.

1086
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:35,208
- Oh, hey, do you have a light?
- Shh!

1087
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:37,000
Okay.

1088
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:38,625
Goddamn.

1089
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:57,750
Motherfucker.

1090
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,875
You're not gonna cry, are you?

1091
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,332
- What?
- When the end comes.

1092
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:20,833
You're not gonna sit there and bawl
your goddamn eyes out, right?

1093
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:24,790
Hey, lady, can you fucking chill please?

1094
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,458
I can't even read my book
and die in peace.

1095
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,708
Goddamn it, Kai.

1096
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:55,791
Oh, Kai, you fucking idiot.

1097
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:23,416
Kai? Kai, we gotta go! The Spike's moving!

1098
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:24,916
Kai!

1099
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,666
Kai, wake up!

1100
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,000
Kai, wake up!

1101
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:36,041
What is this?

1102
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,791
Kai?

1103
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:41,750
Kai?

1104
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:48,041
Kai? The Spike is moving!
The Spike is moving!

1105
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:50,583
Thalia?

1106
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,916
- What the hell is going on?
- Where are you?

1107
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:58,624
We're in the Spike or something.
I don't know. Just keep talking.

1108
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,708
- I'm trying to find you.
- What are you talking about?

1109
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:04,416
Help!

1110
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:10,249
We gotta go.

1111
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:12,166
Kai? I think there's a way out!

1112
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:27,500
No! No! God! No!

1113
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,208
Dave, wake up! Dave, no!

1114
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:34,416
Did he say anything
before he left this morning?

1115
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:37,291
We were supposed
to go on a road trip today.

1116
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:39,832
He wasn't there when I woke up.

1117
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:55,583
Kai.

1118
01:29:56,708 --> 01:30:01,499
- Leave me alone.
- Kai! Kai! We gotta get out of here!

1119
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,832
Leave me alone!

1120
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,790
You sure, Mommy? You sure?

1121
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:17,374
Yeah, just make sure Daddy gets
some dinner on the way home.

1122
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:19,457
Twelve pepperoni pizzas? Got it.

1123
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:24,165
- Pizza party!
- Pizza party! Pizza party! Oh!

1124
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:27,249
- You're so big!
- You're such a dork.

1125
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,540
Love you too.

1126
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:32,875
Pizza party! Let's go!

1127
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:36,040
Wait! Don't go!

1128
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,374
Kai! Stay there! I'm coming!

1129
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:59,957
So? What do you think?

1130
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:07,374
This is such a fucking stupid car.

1131
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:13,625
I know. I know. It's perfect.

1132
01:31:19,416 --> 01:31:22,166
Kai! The Spike is moving! We gotta go!

1133
01:31:24,875 --> 01:31:26,083
I can't go with you.

1134
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:36,166
Kai, what's the matter? Tell me, please.

1135
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:39,499
I'm scared.

1136
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:43,958
I'm angry.

1137
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,125
How could he do that?

1138
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:52,583
Why? I...

1139
01:31:57,416 --> 01:31:59,416
I just can't do it again, Thalia.

1140
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:02,458
Do what?

1141
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:04,916
Care.

1142
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:11,875
I didn't want to,
but now I know you and...

1143
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,541
I care about you.

1144
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:19,000
I just can't do it again, okay?

1145
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:24,333
How could it end well
if you never really know someone?

1146
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,500
Kai, you're gonna die if you stay here.

1147
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:34,916
Here, somewhere else.

1148
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:38,750
It doesn't matter.

1149
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,375
Tell me I'm wrong.

1150
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:48,333
I don't know.

1151
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:53,041
I wish I knew how to help you.
I don't know.

1152
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:58,750
You lied to me.

1153
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,125
- When?
- Can I ask you a question?

1154
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:09,833
Does it ever get easier?

1155
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,958
What do you want me to tell you?

1156
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:17,958
The truth.

1157
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,750
Please.

1158
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,291
I can't help you with that.

1159
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,083
Why not?

1160
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:31,333
Because I don't know.

1161
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:36,249
Does it get easier?

1162
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,916
Yeah, sure. It gets easier.

1163
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:50,416
That's what you're supposed to say, right?

1164
01:33:57,291 --> 01:33:58,500
I'm so sorry.

1165
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,041
I just wanted to be dead.

1166
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,125
To be gone.

1167
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:19,958
Because it never ends.

1168
01:34:22,083 --> 01:34:25,000
Every time I remember them,
I lose them again.

1169
01:34:28,166 --> 01:34:32,583
How can I be happy
when they're always here?

1170
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:35,541
Just around the corner.

1171
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:39,208
But out of reach.

1172
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:50,625
It never gets easier.

1173
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,124
Fuck. Fuck you!

1174
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:04,916
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

1175
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,500
It never gets easier.

1176
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:23,458
But sometimes, something happens.

1177
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:28,041
You don't realize it at the time, but...

1178
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,083
it changes things.

1179
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:33,791
Kai. Kai.

1180
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:40,125
Maybe it's something you do,
or maybe it's fate.

1181
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,458
But you realize...

1182
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,208
you're not alone.

1183
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:01,541
You're not alone.

1184
01:37:07,916 --> 01:37:09,416
So you coming with me or not?

1185
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:18,249
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1186
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:44,666
Just find something that makes you happy.

1187
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,375
Hang on to that.

1188
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,750
What the fuck?

1189
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:11,707
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Are you okay?

1190
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:13,124
Yeah, I think so.

1191
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:15,165
Oh, my God.

1192
01:38:15,166 --> 01:38:17,082
I can't believe we're still here.

1193
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:19,665
Ow!

1194
01:38:19,666 --> 01:38:21,874
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

1195
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,207
- What's wrong?
- Oh, my foot.

1196
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:24,791
Is it stuck on something?

1197
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:27,833
Oh, shit.

1198
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:30,499
What? What is it?

1199
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:33,083
Uh, I'm not really sure
how to explain this one.

1200
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,540
Oh, my God.

1201
01:38:38,541 --> 01:38:41,415
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1202
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:43,540
Just don't move. Just don't move.

1203
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:45,374
No, fuck that.
Break it off or something.

1204
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:46,540
- What? No.
- Yes.

1205
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:47,957
- No.
- What if it spreads?

1206
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:50,415
I give you full consent.
Just rip it out, okay?

1207
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:52,540
- No, I'm not gonna do that.
- Full consent. Just rip it out.

1208
01:38:52,541 --> 01:38:54,250
Okay, I'm just gonna--

1209
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:56,165
No, no, no.

1210
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:58,124
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1211
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:00,124
It's okay. It's okay. Um...

1212
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:02,332
- Okay, I'm gonna go get help.
- No, don't you dare.

1213
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:05,624
Don't you dare leave me. Just ding it.

1214
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:08,833
- What?
- Ding it.

1215
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,125
Ding it.

1216
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:15,208
Okay. Um...

1217
01:39:17,208 --> 01:39:18,083
Ding it, okay.

1218
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:20,208
Uh...

1219
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:23,875
Okay, one...

1220
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:28,582
No, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't.

1221
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:30,749
- I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up.
- Okay, screw it.

1222
01:39:39,875 --> 01:39:40,708
You know what?

1223
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,165
It doesn't even hurt that bad.

1224
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:44,957
- Oh, thank God.
- Weird.

1225
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:49,541
Whoa.

1226
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:57,958
You folks all right? I heard screams.

1227
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:02,999
Yeah, we're okay.
Just, you know, a little shaken up.

1228
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,665
Holy shit.

1229
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:08,415
- You're telling me. It got dark so fast.
- Yeah, we know.

1230
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:10,500
Did you two see things?

1231
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:12,500
I was seeing things.

1232
01:40:13,791 --> 01:40:15,290
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

1233
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:18,916
Well, if you folks are all right,
I think I'm gonna head off.

1234
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,666
- Bye.
- I think I'm gonna call my mom.

1235
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:25,832
- I got a lot of stuff to say.
- Cool, man.

1236
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:26,750
Bye.

1237
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:39,250
You're probably gonna have to
take first shift.

1238
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,291
- Lead foot and all.
- Yeah, it's fine.

1239
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:48,458
Oh, I am sore all over.

1240
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:50,999
Oh, my gosh.

1241
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,207
Wow. That looks weird.

1242
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:55,207
Oh, I hope it didn't get
in my muscles or anything.

1243
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:57,041
Don't wanna get cancer.

1244
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:02,041
- What?
- Nothing.

1245
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:04,333
I get it. My nubs are weird.

1246
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,166
No, it's not that.

1247
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:10,958
You have nice calves.

1248
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:14,999
I like calves, and you have nice ones.

1249
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,875
- What?
- Okay.

1250
01:41:17,583 --> 01:41:20,875
- These do it for you?
- Yes, unfortunately.

1251
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:23,791
Okay.

1252
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:25,999
I thought it was my charm.

1253
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,290
- Whoa.
- Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1254
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:31,874
Definitely not your charm.

1255
01:41:34,916 --> 01:41:36,375
Well, I like your calves too.

1256
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:42,707
I've never looked at your calves,
but if they're half as nice as your ass...

1257
01:41:42,708 --> 01:41:45,249
Oh, my God.

1258
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,207
You know what?
Never mind. It is your charm.

1259
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,833
Thanks for coming back for me.

1260
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:01,625
Thanks for having nice calves.

1261
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:05,458
- You're making it weird.
- Yeah.

1262
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,083
Hey, look.

1263
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:13,291
Are those your bees?

1264
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:15,458
Who knows?

1265
01:42:16,916 --> 01:42:19,125
But I'm going to get these buzz boys
a new home.

1266
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:33,499
You ladies keep bringing friends,
I'm gonna have to get us another box.

1267
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:51,874
- I thought you were working this morning.
- I was.

1268
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:54,915
Then I got an emergency call from somebody
saying they needed some coffee.

1269
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:56,707
Oh, and breakfast?

1270
01:42:56,708 --> 01:43:00,790
I don't know.
I'll have to examine the patient first.

1271
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:01,708
You're gross.

1272
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:05,665
Did you drive the ambulance here?

1273
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:07,874
- Are you even allowed to do that?
- Shut up, narc.

1274
01:43:08,666 --> 01:43:10,874
- You want breakfast or what?
- Yes, I want breakfast.

1275
01:43:10,875 --> 01:43:13,250
- Just let me clean up.
- Yeah, I was gonna say.

1276
01:43:14,416 --> 01:43:15,333
Excuse me.

1277
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:19,207
That is the sweat of a working woman.
Smell it.

1278
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:20,082
- No.
- Smell it.

1279
01:43:20,083 --> 01:43:21,999
- No, I'm okay.
- Smell my glory!

1280
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,832
- Smell it!
- Get off me. Get off me.

1281
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:27,124
You're absolutely nuts.
I was kidding, by the way.

1282
01:43:27,125 --> 01:43:28,290
Oh, really?

1283
01:43:28,291 --> 01:43:30,665
Yes, I've been working all day unlike you.

1284
01:43:30,666 --> 01:43:32,915
I have been working.
You smell how much I've been working!

1285
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:34,040
- No, no!
- Smell it.

1286
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,915
- You're so terrible!
- You know you want it!
